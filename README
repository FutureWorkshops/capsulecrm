= CapsuleCRM

This is a ruby wrapper for the CapsuleCRM API.  It is alpha software and should be considered a work in progress.  It currently supports People & Organisations.  There is support for CustomFields & Contacts but they are read-only.

== Installation

  [sudo] gem install capsulecrm

  gem 'capsulecrm' # rails
  require 'capculecrm' # non-rails

== Getting started

You will need to supply the gem with your CapsuleCRM API token and account name. The account name is the first part of your CapsuleCRM url:

  CapsuleCRM.account_name = "test-account" # http://test-account.capsulecrm.com
  CapsuleCRM.api_token = 'MY_API_TOKEN'
  CapsuleCRM.initialize!

If you're using rails, you can put that in config/initializers/capsulecrm.rb
